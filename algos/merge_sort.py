    With this I will code merge sort

# Merge procedure should take
# p = low
# q = mid
# r = high
# Each are indicies
# Assumes that subarray A[p..q] and A[q+1..r] are sorted
# Will merge these two arrays to form new subarry A[p..r]
# Takes O(n) where n = high - low + 1 -- total number of elements merged
# Two piles of cards
#   Merge two piles
#   Each pile is sorted smallest on top
#   Merge to single output array
#   Choose smaller of two cards on top and place it in new pile
#   Repeat until one pile is empty then just fill remaining
